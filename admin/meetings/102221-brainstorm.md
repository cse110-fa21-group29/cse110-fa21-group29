## Purpose Of Meeting

To expand on the ideas discussed in the previous brainstorm meeting.  

## Decisions Made

The main purpose of the meeting was to revise the target audience of the app. The decision was made that the app be focused on fitness and health enthusiasts to have a more focused scope on the project.

## Agenda and Meeting Notes

Since the target audience is more specific, we needed to expand upon the target market section. Several rough drafts of personas were created and previous ones were given more depth.
- College students (more depth added)
- Stay-at-home mom (more depth added)
- People that want to try dieting
- People that work out a lot
- Foodie that tries new meals
- Office workers (more depth added)
- People looking to lose weight
- Aspiring chef
- Meal prepper
- Recent graduates
- Seniors

Expanded on features based on our new target audience and discussed the priority of implementation based on what features are most important.

- Core Features (the must-have features)
  - Homepage that shows recipes
  - Add/remove/edit recipes
  - Add pictures to recipes
- Core 2 features (features that should be implemented)
  - Recipe categories/tags
  - Search
  - Timer
  - Sharing system
  - Print-friendly screen
  - Quick facts box at top of recipe page
- Fitness features (features that relate to the target audience)
  - Meal planner
  - Hands-free recipe mode
- Bonus features (features that may be implemented based if above goals are met)
  - Calculated recipe costs based on the cost of ingredients
  - User login system
  - Group/favorite recipes
  - Videos within recipes


We will first start by making the recipe manager aggregator based and if time allows we will implement user inputted recipes.

Baha wrote down some APIs that may help us implement the aggregator.
- Spoonacular
- Edenmam

Since we modified our target audience, the user expectations needed to be expanded upon. Also, we dicussed some additional points that all users would expect out of any app.
The following was added:
- Easy to discover new recipes
- Prominence of healthiness
- Consistency/familiarity (UX similar to other recipe apps)

The following apps/websites were looked at for additional inspiration.
- Fit Men Cook
- Healthy Fitness Meals

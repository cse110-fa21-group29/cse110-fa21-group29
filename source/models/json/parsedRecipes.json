    "steps": "<ol><li><span></span>Remove the cauliflower's tough stem and reserve for another use. Using a food processor, pulse cauliflower florets until they resemble rice or couscous. You should end up with around four cups of \"cauliflower rice.\"</li><li>Heat 1T butter and 1T oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and the white and light green pieces of scallion. Saut\u00e9 about a minute.</li><li>Add the cauliflower to the pan. Stir to coat with oil, then spread out in pan and let sit; you want it cook a bit and to caramelize (get a bit brown), which will bring out the sweetness. After a couple of minutes, stir and spread out again.</li><li>Add cold rice (it separates easily, so it won't clump up during cooking), plus the additional grapeseed and coconut oil or butter. Raise heat to medium-high. Toss everything together and, again, spread the mixture out over the whole pan and press a bit into the bottom. Let it sit for about two minutes\u2014so the rice can get toasted and a little crispy. Add the peas and broccoli and stir again. Drizzle soy sauce and toasted sesame oil over rice.</li><li>Cook for another minute or so and turn off heat. Add chopped scallion tops and toss.</li><li>I like to toast some sesame seeds in a dry pan; I sprinkle these and some more raw, chopped scallion over the top of the rice for added flavor and crunch.</li><li>Season to taste with salt and, if you'd like, more soy sauce. Keep in mind that if you're serving this with something salty and saucy (ie. teriyaki chicken) you may want to hold off on adding too much salt to the fried rice.</li></ol>",

    "ingredients": [
      "6-7 large swiss chard leaves, rinsed and dried",
      "1 small head of orange cauliflower",
      "1 1/2 Tbs olive oil",
      "3 cloves garlic, pressed or minced",
      "pinch of salt",
      "1 sprig of fresh basil, leaves finely chopped",
      "1 medium zucchini (courgette)",
      "1 large red pepper, thinly sliced",
      "1 medium avocado, sliced",
      "3-4 Tbs Trader Joe's Asian Style Spicy Peanut Vinaigrette (or your favorite sauce)"
    ],
    "steps": "Chop off the stems of the swiss chard at the point where it meets the leaf. You could stem the swiss chard entirely. I like leaving a bit of stem with the leaves to give better structure to the wraps.\nChop the cauliflower into small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until it looks like rice. I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together.\nPlace the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two, or until the garlic starts to brown. Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir.\nSpiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer, just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler.\nTo assemble the wraps, place a large leaf flat down. Add a bit of sauted cauliflower, zucchini noodles, red pepper, and avocado along the swiss chard stalk. Drizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up.\nEnjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein! Feel free to dip these wraps in more sauce.\nThese wraps are best consumed when they are freshly made. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container.",

      "4 medium sweet potatoes",
      "6 tablespoons unsalted butter"
    ],
    "steps": "<p>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Poke your sweet potatoes with a fork and place them directly on the rack of your oven. Place a piece of foil on the rack below to reduce mess. Bake the sweet potatoes for 45-50 minutes or until tender. Times may vary depending on how hot your oven gets.Remove the potatoes from the oven and let stand at room temperature until they are cool enough to handle, about 20-30 minutes. Leave the oven on.While your potatoes are cooling, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue to cook the butter, stirring frequently, until brown bits begin to form on the bottom of the pan, about 5-6 minutes. Pay close attention as the butter can quickly go from brown to burnt in a matter of seconds. Once you see the brown bits forming and a nutty aroma fills the air, pull the butter from the heat immediately. Set aside.Cut the tops off of the sweet potatoes, lengthwise. Scoop the sweet potato flesh into a medium bowl, leaving the skins in tact. To the bowl, add the brown butter, 2 tablespoons of the fresh parsley, 3/4 of the chopped bacon, and 4 ounces of the goats cheese. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper to taste and mash the ingredients together until combined. Scoop the filling back into the sweet potatoes.Place the potatoes on a baking sheet that has been lined with foil or parchment paper. Place them back in the oven to bake for 25 minutes.While your potatoes are baking for a second time, prepare your avocado cream. In the bowl of your food processor or blender, combine the avocados, sour cream and buttermilk. Add a dash of salt and pepper and pulse until completely smooth and creamy.Once your potatoes have baked, remove from oven. Sprinkle on the remaining parsley, bacon and goats cheese. Drizzle with avocado cream and serve immediately.Enjoy!I hope you enjoy this recipe for brown butter twice baked sweet potatoes!</p>",

      "2 cups (475 ml) all purpose unbleached flour",
      "2 cups (475 ml) whole wheat flour",
      "1/2 cup (130 ml) warm water (warmer than room temp but not warm enough to be uncomfortable to the touch)",
      "1/2 package (1 teaspoon/5ml) active dry yeast",
      "1 cup (235 ml) warm water (same as the first)",

      "crumbled feta",
      "fresh basil, cut into thin ribbons",
      "of course salt"
    ],
    "steps": "First off, mix the flours together and whisk so they are combined well.\nThis recipe requires you to make a sponge. For this you take 1/2 cup of flour and place in a large bowl with the half cup warm water and the yeast. Cover the bowl with plastic and let stand anywhere from 2-8 hours. This is to allow it to ferment, I personally couldn't wait the whole time, I think I made it a minute past the 2 hour mark.\nStir in the 1 cup of water a little at a time. Add in the salt and just enough of the flour to make the dough pull away from the sides of the bowl.\nTurn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead enough flour to make a soft dough. It should be smooth and elastic. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat the dough ball lightly, and cover. Place in a warm place where a draft cannot get to it and allow to rise about 1 hour.\nPrep a large baking pan (pizza pan works well) by either taking an oiled napkin and running it around the pan or line with parchment paper.\nPunch the dough down and allow to rest 10 minutes.\nOil your hands and place dough in the pan. Brush the top of the dough with oil then, using your fingers, make deep dimples in the dough, about 1/2 inch. Cover with plastic again and let rest in a warm place for 30 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 400F(200C).\nTake the olives, feta and basil and spread on top of the foccacia. Sprinkle salt on top and place in oven. Bake 18 - 20 minutes  or until golden. Check about half way through and deflate any large bubbles with the poke of a knife.\nWhen done cooking, place on a rack to cool for about 15 - 20 minutes.\nThis bread is very versatile. You can make it into small mini loaves (as in the original recipe) or in a big one like I did. You can also top it with a number of different ingredients, just let your craving drive you :D!",

    "description": "White Bean & Squash Dip requires roughly roughly 45 minutes from start to finish. For $1.99 per serving, this recipe covers 48% of your daily requirements of vitamins and minerals. One serving contains 542 calories, 18g of protein, and 6g of fat. This recipe serves 3. 1 person has made this recipe and would make it again. It is a good option if you're following a gluten free, dairy free, lacto ovo vegetarian, and vegan diet. It is brought to you by Foodista. It is perfect for The Super Bowl. A mixture of cannellini beans, bulb of garlic, tsp olive oil, and a handful of other ingredients are all it takes to make this recipe so tasty. It works well as a hor d'oeuvre.

    "ingredients": [
      "3 medium globe squash (or 3 medium zucchini)",
      "1 bulb of garlic",
      "1 Tbs + 1 tsp olive oil",
      "1 15-ounce can of cannellini (white kidney) beans, rinsed and drained",
      "1/2 tsp sea salt, add more to taste"
    ],
    "steps": "Preheat oven to 400F (~205C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nChop the top off the garlic bulb, exposing the cloves. Rip a sheet of aluminum foil, and place the garlic bulb on top. Drizzle a teaspoon of olive oil over the garlic, making sure to cover all exposed cloves. Wrap the garlic loosely with foil, but make sure that it is properly sealed. You want to trap heat inside the foil pouch. Bake the garlic for about 35-45 minutes, or until the cloves are browned. Mine took about 45 minutes.\nChop off the tops and bottoms of each globe squash, and then chop them into small cubes. If you want to create a squash bowl like I did in the photo, save one globe squash for the bowl. Just chop off the top and, using a spoon, dig out all the flesh. Toss the squash with a tablespoon of oil and a small pinch of salt, and bake on the baking sheet for about 20 minutes.\nWhen the garlic is done, open up the foil wrap and let it cool for 10-15 minutes. When the garlic is cool enough to handle, squeeze out the cloves into a food processor.\nAdd the cannellini beans, roasted squash, and salt into the food processor and blend until smooth. Enjoy as a dip or add it to a pasta dish!\nRefrigerate leftovers in an airtight container.",

Spread the pasta on a baking sheet, slide it into the oven, and toast, tossing occasionally with tongs, until golden brown, about 12 minutes.\n2.Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large pot (at least 5 1/2 quarts) with a lid over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and a pinch of salt and cook, allowing them only to soften and grow aromatic but not brown, about 5 minutes. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the zucchini and another pinch of salt. Saut until the zucchini is well browned, about 5 more minutes.\n3.Place the noodles on top of the zucchini mixture. Layer the asparagus and 1 cup of the cherry tomatoes on top of that and sprinkle in the smoked paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper, oregano, and rosemary. Pour the red wine and  cup of water over the top. Toss as best you can with tongs; it will be hard at first because the noodles are stiff. Return the heat to medium and cover the pot.\n4.Every 3 minutes, remove the lid and toss the pasta. The total cooking time will be 8 to 12 minutes. Toward the end, taste a noodle each time you remove the lid to see if it is done. If not, and there isnt any moisture left on the bottom of the pot, add a bit more wine or water, about 1/3 cup.\n5.When the noodles are done to your liking, taste and make any final adjustments to the seasoning. Transfer to serving bowls. Garnish with the remaining 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, the parsley, and another grind of black pepper. Serve immediately.",

Place in the oven and BROIL till tender and charred- about 10-15 minutes.\nWhile the squashes are roasting, in a large skillet, spray with PAM and add vegetable oil and set over medium heat. Add the cashews and saute until fragrant and slightly darkened. Add onions and peppers, sprinkle with black pepper and saute until soft, about 5-7 minutes. Once the onions and peppers are soft, but now brown, add the soaked basmati rice (make sure not to get any water in it!). Saute for 5-7 minutes. You want to toast the the rice.\nRemove the squash from the oven and cool for a few minutes before handling. Score the squash into small cubes, WITHOUT cutting through the skin. Scoop the cubes out into a bowl and set aside. Keep the shell aside, DONT throw out!\nOnce the rice is toasted add 1 cup of water, pinch of saffron, cover and cook on medium-low heat, about 15 minutes. You want the rice to be cooked thru, not mushy so dont mix it around too much! Once the rice is cooked, add the cubed squash, tossing gently (you dont want the squash to break and mush around the rice). Add the Biryani paste and toss to coat. Mix in 3/4 of the chopped cilantro. Taste for salt and biryani flavor- it should be strong, spicy and aromatic.\nIn a small skillet, spray with PAM and set over medium-high heat.

Chop the leek (cut in 1/2 lengthwise first & make sure to rinse very well!!) and set aside (separate from the onions & garlic).

In a large pan over medium/high heat, cook the sausages until they are a nice golden brown. While cooking, break apart the mixture until it looks like ground meat.\nTake the meat out of the pan and save it in a bowl. Add 2 tbsp olive oil and add the sage to the pan. Cook for a minute, add the leeks & cayenne pepper. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes and put the meat back in the pan. When the leek is cooked, turn off the heat and keep in the mixture in the pan.\nFor the tomato sauce:\nIn a medium size pot over medium/ high heat, add 1 tbsp olive oil, thyme, garlic & onions. Cook for 3-4 minutes, until onions are translucent. Add crushed tomatoes, lower the heat and simmer for about 20 minutes (with a lose lid, otherwise the sauce will splatter all over your kitchen walls!) Add sugar and about 1 tsp kosher salt (1/2 tsp for regular salt), stir and cook for another 2 minutes. Puree the tomatoes until smooth. Add milk and butter, and stir. Keep the heat on very low or turn off until you are ready to serve.\nWhen rigatoni is cooked, add to the hot pan with the sausage mixture. Stir well, add a little olive oil if it looks dry. Plate and add tomato sauce to the pasta. Serve this way or with parmesan.",

Leave it to brown on one side and then turn it with your spoon so that it browns. If you stir or move it too soon it will stick.\n3.Add the onion, carrot, ginger, garlic and chili. Turn the heat to medium, cover the pan and allow to sweat for a couple of minutes. You will notice that this process creates steam which lifts off the colour at the bottom of the pan  this is what you want because that colour is flavour.\n4.Add the rest of the ingredients, bring to a good simmer, then turn down the heat to a medium/low, cover your pan.\n5.I like to stay around for a little while to check that it is simmering gently. The reason being if the heat is too low it will not cook and if it is too high the meat will not tenderize.\n6.Once you get it to a gentle simmer, cook until the meat is soft, checking only occasionally to make sure its not drying out. If it does, this probably means that your heat is too high  add a little water and adjust the temperature.\n7.Check for seasoning before serving.",

    ],
    "steps": "<ol><li>Begin by preheating the oven to 120C. An efficient oven is important for this dish. If the oven is too cold, the fish will not get cooked. If the oven tends to get too hot, the fish will be roasted and overcooked. If you are uncertain, then think about whether your cookies/cakes are usually overdone or underdone when you follow a recipe exactly. If they are always overdone, then you can turn down the temperature to 110C.</li><li>Get the freshest salmon fillets you can get your hands on. The thick ones are the nicest for this dish.</li><li>Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to the salmon fillets and rub it all over the fish.</li><li>Season generously with salt and pepper. About 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. I usually use Masterfoods Garlic Pepper for each time that I need salt and pepper. Rub the seasonings all over the fish.</li><li>Slice two lemons into thick slices, discarding the ends. Lay the slices of lemons on a baking tray lined with baking paper.</li><li>Place the salmon fillets on top of the lemon slices. If you have left the skin on for the fillets, then make sure its skin side down.</li><li>Place the salmon fillets in the oven and cook for 25 mins. If the salmon fillets are very thick, cook a little longer for another 3 to 5 mins.</li><li>While the fish is cooking, prepare the vegetable medley and sauce.</li><li>Peel a large carrot and diagonally slice into thin slices.</li><li>Wash and pluck the leaves of a bunch of spinach. I used about 150g of baby spinach.</li><li>Heat a deep saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of cooking oil. Keep the heat at medium heat.</li><li>When the oil is hot, add 1 tablespoon of butter.</li><li>When the butter has melted, add the carrots and stir fry for a minute to cook and soften the carrots. I like them slightly crunchy so I dont cook them for too long here. Keep the heat at medium.</li><li>Remove the cooked carrot slices and set aside in a warm place.</li><li>In the same pan, add 1 tablespoon of minced garlic. Stir fry for 20 seconds.</li><li>Add the spinach leaves. Stir fry at medium heat.</li><li>Add salt and pepper to taste. About 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. I used Masterfoods Garlic Pepper seasonings instead again.</li><li>Stir fry the spinach till its soft and wilted. Careful not to overcook as they would lose their natural pretty green colour.</li><li>Dish up the cooked spinach and set aside in a warm place.</li><li>Now make the sauce.</li><li>Peel off the hard outer layer of 2 stalks of lemon grass. Slice into 2 inch long pieces and using the back of your knife, bash the lemongrass and bruise the slightly for the fragrance and flavours to emit.</li><li>Add 1 tablespoon of butter to a small saucepan.</li><li>When the butter has melted and is bubbling slightly, add the lemongrass. Cook at medium heat for 30 seconds.</li><li>Add 150ml of fresh liquid cream. Let the mixture come to a gentle rolling boil.</li><li>Add 1 teaspoon of liquid chicken stock concentrate. Or you can use 1/2 cube of chicken stock bouillon. Stir it in well, and do a taste check. If its not salty enough, add more chicken stock.</li><li>Whisk the sauce as it boils and thickens.</li><li>After a couple of minutes, the sauce would have thickened. Remove the lemongrass.</li><li>Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. I usually use a strainer and squeeze a lemon directly over the sauce. Do a taste check. Add more lemon juice if necessary. Whisk well to combine.</li><li>The salmon should be done by now. Remove them from the oven.</li><li>Plate your dish but placing some spinach and carrots at the bottom of a plate or shallow dish.</li><li>Gently place the salmon fillet on top. Drizzle a generous amount of sauce around the fish. Garnish with chives.</li></ol>",

      "1 teaspoon sesame oil",
      "1 tablespoon rice vinegar",
      "1/2 of large Asian radish (Daikon) cut up into small pieces"
    ],
    "steps": "Cut Napa cabbage in half the long way.\nCut the stem out at bottom.\nCut each cabbage half in half again.\nCut each cabbage quarters into strips of one or two inches thick each.\nPut cut up cabbage into large pot with 3/4 to 1 gal of water.\nAdd 4oz of salt.\nMake sure salt is dissolved in water.\nCover pot for 2 to 4 hours.\nCome back after 2 to 4 hrs.\nStrain cabbage into a collander.\nShake off excess water then gently squeeze out excess water.\nNow put a little bit of cabbage back into pot and sprinkle just a little bit of salt on it. Do this a little bit at a time. A layer of cabbage and then just a touch of salt.\nWhen all done put lid on pot and let stand for 30 minutes.\nTime To Make The Sauce:\nTbsp. rice flour added to 1/2 cup water in sauce pan.\nHeat medium until it boils and thickens. This is rice flour glue that allows other ingredients to stick to the cabbage. Once thickened, let cool.\nKorean Chili Paste:\nTake garlic, ginger, Asian radish and blend in food processor or blender until it is a pulpy liquid.\nWhen the rice flour glue has cooled add the Korean chili powder, sugar, fish sauce, sesame oil, and rice vinegar and mix it up well.\nThen take the pulpy liquid of garlic, ginger, radish and add it to the glue mixture and mix it all up well.\nTime To Mix It Up:\nNow uncover the cabbage that is in the pot on your counter and get another big pot or mixing bowl out.\nTake a little bit of the cabbage from bowl one and put it into bowl two then take a spoonful of the chili paste and mix it with the cabbage.\nRepeat this step: layer of cabbage then spoonfuls of paste and mix together.\nRepeat this step until all the cabbage has been moved from bowl one to bowl two and all the chili paste has been used up.\nOnce all the cabbage has been coated with all the chili paste then move it from the pot that you have mixed it up in and put the kim chi into a large air tight jar. I find that one large head of Napa cabbage prepared into kim chi will fill a 2 quart jar easily. Once transferred into your jar put jar in a cool place with no sunlight for 2 to 3 days to let it ferment, if you see it bubbling this is a good thing. Put in refrigerator. It will keep for up to 2 months.\nI am sure once made it will not last that long!",

The corning of the beef makes the beef salty enough, so no need to add more.\nHeat 1 TBSP oil in a large, shallow oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and sear each side for about 3 minutes, just to develop a nice brown crust. This will seal in the beef's juices.\nRemove beef to a plate. Pour guinness into the pot to deglaze. Scrape up any browned bits. Add beef broth, pickling spice, brown sugar, bay leaf, and minced garlic. Bring mixture up to a simmer.\nReturn the beef to the pot with any additional juices that have accumulated on the plate.\nCover the pot and place on the bottom rack in your oven. Bake for 2 1/2 - 3 hours, or until a fork can easily be inserted into the meat.\nBaste the meat with the surrounding juices every 30 minutes or so.\nAfter 2 hours, add carrots, parsnips, and potatoes to the pot. They will only take about 25-30 minutes of simmering to cook.\nRemove pot from the oven. Place beef on a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving into thin slices (cut against the grain of the meat). Remove vegetables and arrange them on a serving platter. Cover with foil. Place the pot on the burner and bring sauce to a boil. Add cabbage and cook for about 7 minutes, until it has softened. Place the cabbage on the serving platter with the other vegetables.\nStrain the sauce in the pot and stir in 2 or 3 TBSP of spicy honey mustard until dissolved. Place in a small dish or gravy boat with a ladle and serve alongside the beef.\nAfter slicing the beef and arranging it on the serving platter, ladle the guinness mustard sauce over the top to rehydrate and glaze the beef and vegetables.",

Feel free to arrange the kabobs as you want. Leave about 1 inch /3 cm of skewer at one and, so you can hold on them and flip them.</li><li>Place the chicken shish kabobs on a baking tray and put them in the oven.

Serve the kabobs warm with baked potato and sauce.<br>If you grill the kabobs on BBQ, the meat and the vegetables will have a better smocked flavor. The way of grilling the kabobs is the same as the baking them in oven, you just have to flip them frequently, careful to not break the skewers.</li><li>Enjoy!</li></ol>",

This recipe from Foodista has 1 fans. From preparation to the plate, this recipe takes approximately approximately 45 minutes. Taking all factors into account, this recipe earns a spoonacular score of 89%, which is tremendous.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1/2 cup of brown rice",
      "4 cups to 6 of water",
      "2 large cloves garlic, minced",
      "2 tablespoons fresh ginger, minced",
      "1 tablespoon canola or grapeseed oil",
      "1/2 pound of shitake mushrooms, chopped",
      "1 tablespoon soy sauce",
      "1/2 cabbage, cut into thin shreds",
      "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil",
      "6 scallions, chopped",
      "2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds",
      "salt, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce,<"
    ],
    "steps": "In a large pot, combine the rice with four cups of water and a little salt.  Bring the rice and water to a boil. Reduce to low heat, cover and gently simmer for a few hours.  Stir the rice periodically to ensure that it does not stick to the bottom.  Add more water if too much evaporates before the rice grains have dissolved enough to provide a good porridge consistency.  Cook the rice three to four hours until you get a thick porridge consistency.\nAs the porridge is finishing, prepare the remaining ingredients.  In a large pan, saut the garlic and ginger for about ten seconds in canola or gape-seed oil over medium heat.  Once the garlic and ginger have released their flavors into the oil, but before they burn, add the chopped mushrooms.  Saut for about 5 minutes until the mushrooms release their water and it has practically evaporated from the pan.  Add the tablespoon of soy sauce and cook a few more seconds until absorbed.  Place the mushrooms in a covered bowl to keep warm.\nWithout rinsing the pan, add the toasted sesame oil, cabbage and a pinch of salt to the same pan and saut for 1 to 2 minutes.  Allow the cabbage to begin to wilt, but avoid over-cooking it.\nServe by dividing the congee into bowls and topping it with the sauted cabbage and mushrooms, chopped green onions and toasted sesame seeds.  Provide soy sauce, rice vinegar and chili oil on the side for dressing the congee.\nNote: You can quickly make your own chili oil by warming some oil in a pan without allowing it to smoke, and adding fresh or dried crushed chilis to cook for a few minutes without burning.  Once cooked, you can either strain out the chilis, or leave them in.",

Place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center and top with basil, mint, cilantro and lettuce. Leave about 1 to 2 inches uncovered on each side.  Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with the lettuce.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and ingredients. Cut and serve at room temperature with dipping sauce.</li><li>The Culinary Chases Note: The rice wrapper can be fussy to handle if you let it soak too long. I usually give it a couple of swishes in the water and then remove. It may feel slightly stiff but by the time you are ready to roll up, the wrapper will become very pliable.  A typical spring roll contains cooked rice vermicelli, slivers of cooked pork and julienned carrots but you can use whatever suits your fancy.  Enjoy!</li></ol>",

    "ingredients": [
      "500g ( - 1.1 pound) of duck breast meat (about 2slabs) \u2013 skin left on",
      "300g ( - 1/2 pound +) baby beets or beetroot",
      "zest of 1 orange",
      "2 teaspoons honey",
      "1 teaspoon salt",
      "3 cups of rocket or arugula greens",
      "4 tablespoons of toasted almond flakes or pine nuts",
      "1 can of mandarin orange segments (drained)",
      "Bunch of fresh mint or basil",
      "Shaved parmesan cheese or crumbled goat or feta cheese",
      "Juice of 1 orange (about 6 tablespoons)",
      "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil",
      "4 teaspoons balsamic vinegar",
      "salt and pepper to taste"
    ],
    "steps": "Pre-heat the oven to 200 deg Celsius (400 F).\nStart by roasting the beetroots. Clean the beets of all mud and trim the stems. Wrap each beet tightly in aluminum foil. Place the wrapped beets on a pan and in a 200 deg Celsius oven for 30 to 40mins. They are done when they are very tender.\nWhile the beets are cooking, use a peeler and peel an orange, taking note to get as much of zest and as little of pith (the white parts) as possible. Stack the strips of orange zest and cut into fine strips with a sharp knife. Set aside.\nClean and dry the duck breasts. Score the skin of the duck. Make cuts into the fat layer and take care not to cut into the meat layer. Rub some salt into the skin side only of the duck. Add the duck breasts to a clean and COLD pan. Do not add any oil. Place the pan on the stove and turn the heat to medium.\nAs the pan heats up, the fat from the duck will render off and the skin will brown beautifully. Always keep the heat to between medium to medium-high. Never use high heat as the skin will burn before the duck is cooked through. Once the skin is a gorgeous dark golden brown, flip the duck breasts to the other side and cook for a few more minutes till the other sides are also golden brown. Be careful not to overcook the duck. Set the cooked duck aside and leave to rest covered with foil. Duck, like beef must be rested. The resting time is half that of cooking time. If the duck was cooked for 6 mins, then it should be rested for at least 3 minutes.\nWhile the duck is resting, make the vinaigrette. Squeeze the juice of the zested orange into a bowl. About 5 to 6 tablespoons of juice. Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Use the best quality one you have. Add 4 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar. Add salt and pepper to taste. Whisk the mixture well. Set aside.\nWhen the beets are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes so that they are easier to hold. Put on some disposable gloves (else get blood red stained fingers later). Open the foil-wrapped beets. Using the rough surface of each piece of foil, rub the beets with the foil to remove the skin. Cut the cooked beets into small pieces. Set aside in a bowl.\nDrizzle 2 tablespoons of vinaigrette into the beets. Add 2 teaspoons of honey. Toss well to coat the beets with the dressing.\nSlice the rested duck into thin slices. The meat should be a beautiful pink.\nServe by layering the salad with greens, nuts and cheese of your choice, and the duck and beets.\nI like rocket greens with fresh basil or mint, mandarin orange segments, toasted almond flakes or pine nuts and some shaved parmesan cheese or some crumbed feta or goats cheese.\nGarnish with the orange zest.\nTrickle the vinaigrette over the salad.\nBest served immediately.",

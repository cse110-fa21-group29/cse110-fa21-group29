## Context and Problem Statement
We must figure out the most pertinent information to display on our recipe card. The recipe card will show the recipe name plus other information that will motivate users to select this recipe.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->
* 	What will be the most impactful information to show to our user demographic? 
*  	What do our users care about most when considering which recipe to choose from? 

## Considered Options
* 	Average review star system
* 	Calorie, Time, and Protein Count for a recipe
* 	Calorie, Time, and Cost for a recipe 

## Decision Outcome
Option 2 is chosen because this will provide the most pertinent information to our users. We believe our user demographic will care about the calories, time, and protein the most over other options. 

## Positive Consequences
*   In comparison to the average review star system, we believe this chosen option will provide more information to what our user demographic cares about. 
*   In comparison to the third option, we believe this chosen option will be easier to implement because we will not have to calculate the total cost of a recipe which is difficult considering prices are arbitrary depending on location and quality. 
*   Our users will immediately be able to prioritize essential parts of a workout diet. This includes how many calories and how much protein which is an essential part of a fitness diet.

### Negative Consequences 
* In comparison to the third option, cost potentially could be an important factor to some of our users, so some of them would potentially prefer the third option to the second option.
